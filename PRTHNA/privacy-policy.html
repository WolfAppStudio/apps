<h3>Cookies and Similar Technologies (&ldquo;Tracking Technologies&rdquo;)&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Cookies are small data files, typically of letters and numbers, that are placed by a web server on your device. We and companies we work with may use cookies and similar technologies, including pixel tags, web beacons, mobile analytics features, and mobile identifiers (collectively, &ldquo;tracking technologies&rdquo;) to collect information for many reasons, such as to keep you logged in to your account, remember your preferences and settings, analyze usage of our Services, measure the performance of our Services and advertising campaigns, and ensure security on our Services.
